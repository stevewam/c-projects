<h1> Assignment: Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm </h1>

<h3> 1. Approach </h3>
To create the algorithm, I followed the suggested approach in the assignment brief. Three different classes are constructed: Graph, PriorityQueue and ShortestPath. Graph and PriorityQueue classes can be found in the header files graph.h and queue.h. The ShortestPath class can be found on the shortest.cpp, which #include graph.h and queue.h.

STLs are used to implement these classes to carry out basic operations. For example, using vector and its operations for storing and retriving information. However, STLs that provide complex functionalities to generate graph, implement priority queue and find shortest path out-of-the-box are avoided. Having to implement these functionalities on my own ensures that I understand their purpose and behaviour.

To implement the Graph class, I referred to the following source.
